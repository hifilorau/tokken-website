                  What is Tokken?
                </h1>
                <p class="answer">
                  Tokken is a mobile platform that extends banking services to cash intensive businesses.
                  Tokken ® platform provides integrated proxy-banking and payment processing services to all cash intensive businesses (currently focusing on the legal cannabis industry). The Tokken ecosystem creates a virtual barrier to cash placement and integration, which eliminates the primary risk of money laundering.

                  <p class="answer">
                    We launched this company to address one of the biggest regulatory discontinuities of the 21st century -- legal cannabis and banking. I am ecstatic about the timing of our launch, as it overlaps two major technological trends in consumer spending: widespread adoption of mobile payments and the emergence of crypto currency.

                  How does it work?
                </h1>
                <p class="answer">
                  Our technology employs a consumer, mobile wallet application and a corresponding merchant add-on that integrates into multiple existing POS systems. Although users experience a seamless mobile transaction (i.e. a purchase via barcode scan), the platform employs a back-end token exchange that keeps actual fiat currency static and in the possession of the bank, while issuing a convertible digital token to retailers. Such transaction distances financial institutions from the statutorily defined "high risk" entities, allowing us to assume and manage the regulatory risk (acting like a third-party compliance department), thus enticing financial institutions to extend services to previously “un-bankable” businesses.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                  To minimize expenses and maximize transparency, we use blockchain technology to record and maintain encrypted transactions. Such arrangement allows us to cooperate with federal and state regulators at a minimum cost (hours and reporting). Lastly, the merchants who use our platform are able to access their pools of tokens that are structured and behave like brokerage accounts (i.e. liquidation of tokens, wire transfers, ACH, etc.). We monetize this relationship by creating a 5% spread on token liquidation, and by charging service fees on typical merchant banking activities.
