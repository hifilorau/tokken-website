                  What is Tokken?
                </h1>
                <p class="answer">
                  Tokken® platform is designed to provide integrated proxy banking and payment processing services to cash-intensive businesses (currently focusing on the legal cannabis industry). These enterprises are considered high-risk by most financial institutions due to their average daily volume of cash that exposes them to potential money laundering schemes. We solve this problem by creating a virtual barrier to cash placement and, by extension, money laundering.

                  <p class="answer">
                     We launched this company to address one of the biggest regulatory discontinuities of the 21st century -- legal cannabis and banking. However, we soon realized that there is a greater need for a consumer- focused, secure payment system in other cash heavy industries. Thus, we created a platform that leverages the latest technological innovation in cryptography and data management to offer banking and payment services to a growing segment of the under-banked and un-banked.

                  How does it work?
                </h1>
                <p class="answer">
                   Our application employs a consumer mobile wallet and a corresponding merchant add-on that integrates into multiple, widely used point-of-sale (POS) systems. Our wallet users experience a seamless and secure transaction involving a quick barcode scan. The scan initiates the transfer of funds from the consumers to merchants via debit or credit. Although it typically takes several days to transfer fiat currency from one account to another, our merchants are funded immediately. We make such transaction speeds possible by employing a back-end digital token system that keeps actual fiat currency in the possession of the bank, while we issue digital tokens at the time a transaction occurs. In turn, the merchants are able to access the accumulated tokens via an online banking portal where they are able to liquidate them at their convenience and use the banking portal for transfer funds. We monetize this relationship by creating a spread on token liquidation, and by charging service fees on typical banking services.
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                  To minimize expenses and maximize transparency, we use blockchain technology to record and maintain encrypted transactions. Such arrangement allows us to cooperate with federal and state regulators at a minimum cost (hours and reporting). Lastly, the merchants who use our platform are able to access their pools of tokens that are structured and behave like brokerage accounts (i.e. liquidation of tokens, wire transfers, ACH, etc.). We monetize this relationship by creating a 5% spread on token liquidation, and by charging service fees on typical merchant banking activities.

                  Regulartory Compliance?
                </h1>
                  <p class="answer">
                    We manage regulatory requirements by dissociating financial institutions from "high risk" entities and assuming all risks and reporting responsibilities. Such configuration entices financial institutions to enter the industry by extending services to previously “un-bankable” entities.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To streamline and automate reporting, we use a blockchain ledger that preserves all encrypted transactions. Such an arrangement creates an environment of transparency that allows us to cooperate with federal/state regulators and law enforcement organizations.
